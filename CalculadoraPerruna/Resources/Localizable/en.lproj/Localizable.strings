This research is based on changes in DNA over time.\n\nThe lifespan of dogs can vary, however they all exhibit a similar pathological, physiological and developmental trajectory.\n\nTo achieve this, blood samples were drawn from 320 people, aged between 1 and 103 years. Also 104 Labradors, from puppies to 16 years.\n\nComparison with human methylomes reveals a non-linear relationship that translates the age of the dog to the human, resulting in a formula for calculating human age with that of dogs.";
